Project Overview:

The Personalized Healthcare Records Database (PHR-DB) project aims to create a user-
centric healthcare database system that empowers patients to access, manage, and monitor
their medical records effectively. The system will enable patients to track their medications,
monitor vital report values, and visualize health trends over time through an intuitive and
secure online platform. PHR-DB will prioritize data accuracy, security, and user-friendliness
to improve patient engagement and healthcare outcomes.
